# Feeling Virtual Space - Eploring Physicality and Space in GUIS with a haptic mouse
This project explores how the physical and spatial properties of GUI elements can be rendered with haptic feedback delivered through a haptic mouse. In three functional prototypes, a combination of visual and tactile stimuli are used to convey sensations of resistance, object boundaries and thickness.
